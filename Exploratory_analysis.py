Problem

In this dataset we have a subset of titanic population and we are asked to build 
a predictive model to say whether a given passenger survived or not in the Titanic disaster. 
We have 10 input variables such as gender, age, and price of fare. 
This is going to be a binary classification problem and we are going to solve it using 
RandomForests, Logistic Regression and SVM.
